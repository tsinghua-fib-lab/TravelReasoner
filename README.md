# TravelReasoner: Leveraging Large Reasoning Models to Address Mobility Data Gap

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and data for **TravelReasoner**.  
TravelReasoner is a novel framework based on **Large Reasoning Models (LRMs)** that aims to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of mobility data simulations. By combining reasoning capabilities with chain-style datasets, it better models the decision-making process behind human travel behavior.

## Repository Structure
- `train/`: Training dataset  
- `test/`: Test dataset  
- `main1_1_large_2000.py`: Core inference script  
- `process_output_individual.py`: Script for processing the outputs generated by LRMs  

## Abstract
Web-based urban platforms increasingly rely on fine-grained mobility data to support societal applications such as epidemic response, emergency management, and political mobilization. However, collecting such data remains challenging due to privacy concerns, security restrictions, low participation rates, and high acquisition costs, and the resulting datasets are often uneven across regions and population groups. We introduce **TravelReasoner**, a framework that leverages large reasoning models (LRMs) to generate interpretable and behaviorally coherent mobility data. We construct **Chain-of-Trips**, a reasoning-aligned dataset derived from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), and develop a curriculum-based post-training pipeline to improve in-domain reasoning consistency. Experiments show that TravelReasoner outperforms strong baselines, improving location consistency by 6.8\% and time consistency by 4.1\%, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. TravelReasoner exhibits good generalization ability, adapting to diverse demographic characteristics and demonstrating strong cross-city generalization. Our findings suggest that interpretable reasoning models have significant potential to promote travel equity, enhance data-scarce urban environments, and contribute to sustainable cities and communities.
