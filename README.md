# TravelReasoner: Reasoning-Augmented Simulation of Travel Surveys with Large Reasoning Models

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and data for **TravelReasoner**.  
TravelReasoner is a novel framework based on **Large Reasoning Models (LRMs)** that aims to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of travel survey simulations. By combining reasoning capabilities with chain-style datasets, it better models the decision-making process behind human travel behavior.

## Abstract
Travel survey simulation plays a central role in urban planning and traffic management. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in this area, prior research has primarily focused on training LLMs to directly fit travel survey data, without fully considering the underlying reasoning behind human decision-making.  The emergence of large reasoning models (LRMs) has enhanced performance on more complex tasks, unlocking new opportunities for improving travel simulation. In this paper, we introduce **TravelReasoner**, a novel framework that enhances travel survey simulations by integrating the reasoning capabilities of LRMs.  Given the challenge of acquiring high-quality reasoning data for travel decisions, we construct the **Chain-of-Trips** dataset — a chain-of-thought dataset derived from real-world National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data. This dataset captures the step-by-step reasoning process behind real-world travel decisions.  To improve the accuracy and rationality of LRMs' in-domain reasoning, we propose a two-stage post-training pipeline combined with supervised fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that TravelReasoner substantially outperforms strong baselines, while producing interpretable intermediate reasoning traces that enable transparent and explainable simulations.  Our findings highlight the promise of LRMs for complex decision modeling and open new opportunities for applying NLP to urban systems.
